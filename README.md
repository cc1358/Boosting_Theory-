1. Primal Problem:
The primal problem in boosting is to minimize the exponential loss function, which measures the discrepancy between the model's predictions and the true labels. The loss function is defined as:


The primal problem in boosting is to minimize the exponential loss function:
\[
L(f) = \mathbb{E}[\exp(-y \cdot f(x))]
\]
where \( y \) is the true label, \( f(x) \) is the model's prediction, and \( \mathbb{E} \) denotes the expectation over the training data.

2. Dual Problem:
The dual problem in boosting involves finding the optimal weights (alphas) for each weak learner that minimize the overall loss. This dual formulation arises from applying Lagrange multipliers to the primal problem, leading to an iterative optimization process. In AdaBoost, the dual problem is solved by updating the weights of the training examples and selecting the weak learner (e.g., decision stump) that minimizes the weighted error at each iteration. The dual perspective provides a theoretical foundation for understanding how boosting algorithms converge and generalize.

3. Coordinate Descent:
Boosting can be viewed as performing coordinate descent on the dual problem. At each iteration, the algorithm greedily selects the weak learner that minimizes the loss and updates the weights of the training examples. This process corresponds to optimizing one coordinate (weak learner) at a time while keeping the others fixed. The iterative nature of boosting ensures that the model improves incrementally, with each weak learner contributing to the overall prediction. This greedy approach is efficient and aligns with the coordinate descent optimization strategy.

4. Connection to Convex Optimization:
The connection between boosting and convex optimization lies in the convexity of the loss function and the iterative optimization process. The exponential loss function used in AdaBoost is convex, ensuring that the optimization process converges to a global minimum. The dual formulation of the problem provides a clear link between boosting and convex optimization, as the weight updates and weak learner selection correspond to solving the dual problem. This connection guarantees that boosting algorithms have strong theoretical guarantees, including bounds on training error and generalization performance
